## Labs from CSE 351 Hardware/Software Interface
This repo contains all of my labs from Hardware/Software Interface, listed below
- [Lab1a Pointers](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CSE351/Lab1a): Implementation of various simple functions requirering lower level knowledge of pointers in C
- [Lab1b Inventory System](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CSE351/Lab1b): A store inventory system implemented using bit shifting and pointers in C
- [Lab2 Debug Bomb](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CSE351/Lab2): A binary "Bomb" that required disassembling and debugging in gdb (GNU debugger) in order to find the correct input string for each phase
- [Lab3 Buffer Bomb](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CSE351/Lab3): A buffer overflow vulnerable binary that required reverse engineering to find an input string that would exploit each phases vulnerability
- [Lab4 Cache Friendly Code](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CSE351/Lab4): This has two different sections. The first one can determine the geometry (block size, cache size, and associativity) of any given cache, and the second part efficiently transposes a 32x32 and 64x64 matrix by taking full advantage the cache
- [Lab5 Heap Manager](https://github.com/LandonDavidson-CSE351/Lab5): Three different sections, mm.c, mm-realloc.c, and mm-gc.c. mm.c is an implementation of a head manager with the c interface of malloc and free using an explicit free list. mm-realloc.c implements C's realloc function, and mm-gc.c implements java like garbage collection using mark and sweep
